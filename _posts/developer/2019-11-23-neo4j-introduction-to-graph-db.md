Neo4J is a fantastic piece of technology that can be applied to numerous situations.
when your data is highly interconnected and queries start to become very long, complex to read and understand.
Neo4j helps us to simplify the data model, because the way that the data is represented is more closely aligned to how we naturally think.

## What is a Graph?
A graph in its simplest form is a collection of nodes and relationships. A node can be an entity such as a person, place, object or relevant piece of data.
And a relationship represents how two nodes are associated.

## Neo4J
Neo4j is a highly scalable native graph database. It provides ACID-compliant transactional backend for your applications. It efficiently implements the property graph model down to the storage level.
Accessing nodes and relationships in a native graph database is an efficient, constant-time operation and allows you to quickly traverse millions of connections per second per cpu core.
Some of the following particular features make Neo4j very popular among developers, architects, and DBAs:
- Performance
- High availability
- Agility
- Security
- Developer friendly
- Scalable

## Cypher
Cypher is Neo4jâ€™s graph query language that allows users to store and retrieve data from the graph database.
Through Cypher, users can construct expressive and efficient queries to handle needed create, read, update, and delete functionality.
