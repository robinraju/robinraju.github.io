***Docker is revolutionizing IT!*** I've been hearing this for a while. My search for what exactly is docker and what it 
can do for me landed me on the their official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

everything needed to run an application in a loosely isolated environment (code, libraries, runtime, system settings, and dependencies). 
These packages are called containers.

They start instantly and use less RAM with minimized disk usage.
